process used was as follows:

1) Create Photoshop as usual with appropriate layering
2) Re-order layers such the top most elements are on top
3) Rasterize Vectors
4) Merge some layers to shorten the generated QML (for clairty)
5) Check that layer names conform to QML item naming conventions
6) Export to QML using the Photoshop Plugin.
7) Fixup QML to hide pressed look layers, etc
